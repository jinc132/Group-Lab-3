    "### __What makes a state \"urban\" or \"not urban\"?__\n",
    "An urban area is the region that surrounds a city. Also, urban areas usually refers to a human settlement that has high population density and infrustructure of a built environment [(SOURCE: Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area). Urban areas include towns and cities - places where opportunities for education, transportation, business and social interaction and overall better standard of living are prevalent [(SOURCE)](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/difference-between-urban-and-rural/). Places with urban areas are filled with densely deveoloped territory and encompass residential, commercial, and other non-residential urban land uses. \n",
    "\n",
    "While \"urban\" areas contain a large amount of human activity, \"not urban\" areas (commonly referred to as rural areas) have less representation of infrastructure. Rural areas are located outside towns and cities. Rural areas have a low representation of population density and small settlements (villages). \n",

    "### _Examples of urban areas and rural areas_\n",
    "- [Los Angeles, CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles): With a population of nearly 18 million, Los Angeles is filled with opportunities and has a high population density. \n",
